# CPSC-312-Battleship

This is a simplified battleship game written in Prolog. Play against a formidable enemy and try to sink their ships! Type 'run.' to start the game and 'fire(Row, Column).' to fire at your enemy. Can you beat them?

To change the placements of your ships, simply change the 'board.txt' file. A valid board consists of 3 1-by-2 ships placed either horizontally or vertically without overlap.

Note: Row and column both start from 0 at the top and left respectively.
